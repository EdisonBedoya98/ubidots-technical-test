### Coding Challenge Guidelines

This challenge is composed of two parts. Use JavaScript and React:

Please check the Readme.md for each folder individually.

### CodeSubmit

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the master branch. After you have pushed your code, you may submit the assignment on the assignment page.

All the best and happy coding,
